# VolumeControlWPF

Just something I made to make your function keys act as volume controls. For now, I have it so that this will only work if scroll lock is on.

F1 - Mute
F2 - Decrease Volume
F3 - Increase Volume

The window doesn't really do anything right now. It's more so that when you hit minimize, it'll minimize to the tray.
